# Caesar-Cipher

This is a jupyter script for Caesar Cipher implementation.
The Encoding part is pretty straight forward. You have to enter a text and a key and the encoded text will be returned.
There are two types of decoding.
1) Decoding with the key given. Here user will enter the text and a key and the decoded text will be returned.
2) Advanced Decoding doesn't ask for a key. User just have to enter an encoded text and the program will return the most
 probable Decoded output. This is not 100% accurate and I am still working on making it more accurate. To get better results
 enter large texts, this might take more time but will return correct output more often.
